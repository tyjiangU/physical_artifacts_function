frame	definition
Wearing	The words in this frame refer to what Clothing the Wearer (or a specific Body_part of the Wearer) has on.  'I had on the most ridiculous monkey-suit you could imagine.' 'These two losers were wearing bras on their heads!'  Many targets incorporate the Clothing item, and some targets describe the state of not wearing something (when it might be expected).  'Do you think anyone would notice if I went topless?'    NB: There is a very common metonymy in which characteristics of the clothing stand for the clothing itself, such as   'the man clad in leather.' 'She was dressed all in red.'  Such sentences should be tagged METAPHOR on the sentence level.
Residence	This frame has to do with people (the Residents) residing in Locations, sometimes with a Co-resident.  'Peter lives in New York.' 'Sue is an inhabitant of Los Angeles.'
Sleep	The Sleeper stays in an altered state of consciousness with greatly reduced external awareness.  'We slept.'
Excreting	An Excreter excretes Excreta.  'Principal Skinner burped on me.' 'Lenny and Karl pee three times a day.'
Grooming	In this frame, an Agent engages in personal body care by grooming either a Patient or a Body_part.  An Instrument can be used in this process as well as a Medium.  'She washed the baby.'
Ingestion	An Ingestor consumes food or drink (Ingestibles), which entails putting the Ingestibles in the mouth for delivery to the digestive system.  This may include the use of an Instrument.  Sentences that describe the provision of food to others are NOT included in this frame.  'The wolves devoured the carcass completely.'
Cause_motion	An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal.  Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   '' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    'She threw her shoes into the dryer .' 'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .' 'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .' '' ''  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): 'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI' 'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .' 'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI' 'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .' ''  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone's intentions as changing their location: 'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .' 'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .' ''  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): 'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .' ''  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: 'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years' 'One can not press this argument too far .' 'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .' 'She flung him a savage little smile .' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked "Metaphor", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. '' ''  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme's position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): ''  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. 'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.' ''  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). 'John filled the box with old toys.' ''  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). 'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.' ''  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. 'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .' ''  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.  
Self_motion	The Self_mover, a living being, moves under its own direction along a Path. Alternatively or in addition to Path, an Area, Direction, Source, or Goal for the movement may be mentioned.   'She walked along the road for a while.'  Many of the lexical units in this frame can also describe the motion of vehicles (e.g., as external arguments). We treat these as belonging in this frame.   'The cars scooted slowly towards the intersection.'  Self_motion most prototypically involves individuals moving under their own power by means of their bodies. Many words also specify the manner of motion (swim, walk). This frame contains mostly words that fit this prototypical scenario, but the frame itself does not specify whether a separate vehicle is impossible, necessary, or unspecified. Lexical units that involve separate vehicles are associated with FEs that are not appropriate for the more general case of motion, so they are placed in the Operate_vehicle or Ride_vehicle frames (e.g., He drove across the country, She flew to Europe).
Competition	This frame is concerned with the idea that people (Participant_1, Participant_2, or Participants) participate in an organized, rule-governed activity (the Competition) in order to achieve some advantageous outcome (often the Prize).  Rank and Score are different criteria by which the degree of achievement of the advantageous outcome is judged.  'He and I played tennis.' 
Contacting	A Communicator (whose Location may be indicated) directs a Communication to an Addressee at a particular Address.  Note that no actual successful communicative act is implied, only the successful completion of acts which would establish the communication.  (In other words, Mari can e-mail Jon without Jon ever reading it.) NB:  The Address or Location_of_communicator may be a virtual address, such as an e-mail or telephone number.'Disgruntled voters phoned Congressman Neil at his Washington residence with complaints about the recent increases in corporate welfare.''She tried to call from the payphone down the street.' 
Perception_experience	This frame contains perception words whose Perceivers have perceptual experiences that they do not necessarily intend to. For this reason we call the Perceiver role Perceiver_passive. Comparing the Perception_experience frame to the Perception_active frame, we note that for some modalities there are different lexical items in each frame.  For instance, whereas Perception_experience has see, Perception_active has look at. For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical items in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell where I smell something rotten exemplifies its Perception_experience use and Smell this to see if it's fresh exemplifies its Perception_active sense. This frame also includes words which are not specific to any sense modality, including detect, perceive, perception, sense.  '' 'Abashed, realising that he had overheard her conversation with Victoria, Sheeley didn't try to make excuses.'  'She smelled the wine on Paul's breath, and bade him to sit down.'
Eclipse	An Obstruction blocks an Eclipsed entity partially or completely from view. The positions of the Obstruction and the Eclipsed entity are often reported relative to a Vantage_point.  'A small green bulb concealed behind the panel flashed on momentarily .'
Reading_activity	A Reader visually examines a Text, typically in a linear order, to understand its content.  In place of the Text, a Topic may be mentioned.  'She ca n't read . INI' 'They read the bible nightly .' 'I 've read about you !'  '' This frame differs from the Reading_perception frame, which obligatorily focuses on the perceptual and cognitive interpretive aspects of reading; unlike Reading_activity, targets in Reading_perception require explicit mention of the Text being examined.  While Reading_activity is broad enough to cover the same circumstances as Reading_perception, it also covers situations where reading is contrasted merely with another task or leisure activity, when reading is considered generically, and when the Topic unifying the reading activity replaces mention of a Text. '' Additionally, this frame differs from Hearsay in that Reading_activity is focused on what the Reader is agentively doing, whereas in Hearsay, the focus is on what the Hearer knows and how they know it.  As a result, most valences are unambiguous: full clause complements for the Message point to the Hearsay frame, while Text or lack of any complement indicates the Reading_activity frame.  The only overlap is in the case of Topic, where the frames can be still distinguished by factivity of the Topic.  In other words, read.v used in the Hearsay frame, just like hear.v in the Hearsay frame, when used with a Topic, indicates clearly that there is some specific fact related to the Topic that the reader or hearer now knows and understands. Thus the first and second of the following sentences belong to Hearsay, the last to Reading_activity: 'Yes, I read about how you won teacher of the year .' 'I just read about the accident .' '' 'I was reading about dinosaurs all day.'   
Make_noise	A physical entity, construed as a point-Sound_source, emits a Sound.  This includes animals and people making noise with their vocal tracts. Sometimes the sound itself is referred to with a nominal expression, in which case it is called the Sound. Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time).
Create_representation	A Creator  produces a physical object which is to serve as a Representation of an actual or imagined entity or event, the Represented.   'Epstein saw the machine-man and carved him in shiny metal.'  'Picasso drew some violent looking birds.'  'Towards the end of his life, Munch painted himself as a ghost.'  'Dan Grant was the model for Norman Rockwell when the artist painted him as "The Barefoot Boy" for a Depression-era Coca Cola calendar.'  'There the Finnish artist sketched him, creating a stunning portrait.'
Performing_arts	The Performers, together with behind the scenes Personnel, execute a Performance according to a Script and/or Score.  The purpose of the Performance is to create an experience for an Audience, who then judge its merits.  Performances may be in many different Mediums and be of various Types.   This frame is very elaborate in modern society and there are a number of traditions and practices typically (but not necessarily) related to Performances:       The Performance is preceded by many practice sessions in which the Performers and other Personnel attempt to improve the quality and/or fidelity of their individual and collective performances to the Script and/or Score.         The Audience members pay a fee to experience the Performance.       The Performers (and Personnel) receive payment for contributing to the Performance.       Often there are other individuals involved in the specifically financial aspects of the Performance and Performers.       Critics act as part of the Audience and then write reviews that evaluate the merits of the Performance, describing the Performance to other potential Audience members.       Due to the high quality of previous Performances, Performers can become famous, i.e. well known and liked.  Those who like them particularly well become fans of the Performer.  (Shared with writers...)
Text_creation	An Author creates a Text, either written, such as a letter, or spoken, such as a speech,  that contains meaningful linguistic tokens, and may have a particular Addressee in mind.  The Text may include information about its topic, although the latter is not an FE in this frame.  'I penned a letter concerning racism  to Congress.' 'The brothers said not two words to each other.' 'Jot any notes you need below the line in red pen only.'
Building	This frame describes assembly or construction actions, where an Agent joins Components together to form a Created_entity, which is profiled, and hence the object of the verb.  'Jack built a new house out of bricks.' 'We glued the airplanes together.'
Dimension	This frame concerns  words that express an Object's position on a scale, its Measurement, with respect to some attribute, its Dimension.  Location,  identifying the sub-region of the Object where the Dimension is measured, may also be expressed.  'The tower is 10 feet tall.'   'The  new vase is 5 cm in circumference at the top.'  Adjectives in this frame must appear with a measurement expression like 5 cm.  Note the tagging of  six feet on the GF and PT layers in the following sentence.  'The woman was six feet tall.'  The GF of six feet is Dep and the PT is NP.
Attaching	The Attaching frame covers two situations: a scene in which somebody causes one thing to be physically connected to something else; or a scene in which somebody causes two things to be connected to each other.  In the first, the frame includes an Agent who attaches an Item to a Goal by manipulating a Connector, creating an asymmetric relationship between the Item and the Goal.  In the second, the Agent attaches two Items to each other, where each serves as a Goal for the other, creating a symmetric relationship between the two Items. In both cases, the  Connector remains to bind the two entities (either Item and Goal, or two Items), without creating a new entity.  'The robber tied Harry to the chair.'  'Make sure you bind his wrists as tightly as possible.'
Protecting	Some Protection prevents a Danger from harming an Asset.  'The rubber on her sneakers protected her from the mud.'  'The coral reefs shielded the coastline from the worst of the waves.'  'A growing number of sustainable farmers are preserving agricultural variety and protecting biodiversity by raising ?heritage? or ?heirloom? varieties.'  'The man responsible for this entire ordeal cowardly shielded himself from justice with the little boy's struggling body.'
Supporting	A Supporter assists to strengthen the Supported by lending itself in material aid (or abstract assistance in the case of metaphorical uses).   'The bottom of the wall is supported by the foundation.'  'Many legislators have supported the industry in the past.'  'The revetment layers buttressed the mud-mortared cobblestone core wall.'  'Online gambling can bolster the US economy.'
Containing	In this frame a Container holds within its physical boundaries the Contents.  'The box holds three hundred pictures.'
Bringing	This frame concerns the movement of a Theme and an Agent and/or Carrier.   The Agent, a person or other sentient entity, controls the shared Path by moving the Theme during the motion. In other words, the Agent has overall motion in directing the motion of the Theme.  The Carrier may be a separate entity, or it may be the Agent's body. The Constant_location may be a subregion of the Agent's body or (a subregion of) a vehicle that the Agent uses.  'Karl carried the books across campus to the library on his head.' 'Karl carried the books across campus to the library in his truck.' 'Karl carried the books across campus to the library by truck.' 'The truck carried the books across campus to the library in specially designed boxes.' The  FEs include Path, Goal, and Source.  Area is an area that contains the motion when the path is understood as irregular.   This frame emphasizes the path of movement as opposed to the FEs Source or Goal as in Filling or Placing. 
Removing	An Agent causes a Theme to move away from a location, the Source.  The Sourceis profiled by the words in this frame, just as the Goal is profiled in the Placing frame.  'I saw that several men in dark suits had removed all of the evidence from the scene.' 'With your index finger prise the meat out of the shell' 'The torrential winds dislodged most of the roof tiles.'
Closure	An Agent manipulates a Fastener to open or close a Containing_object (e.g. coat, jar).  Sometimes an Enclosed_region or a Container_portal may be expressed. Since the Manipulator is syntactically omissible, many verbs in this frame incorporate the Fastener.  'Mary closed her coat with a belt.' 'Mary closed her coat with one hand.' 'Mary buttoned her coat .'
Cause_fluidic_motion	An Agent or a Cause causes a Fluid to move from a Source to a Goal along a Path or within an Area.  'I splattered red paint nearby.'
Cause_to_be_dry	An Agent causes a Dryee (either a surface or an entire entity, inside and out) to become dry. This should not include examples like "drying tears" or "drying spills" as these are in the Removing frame.  'Michael dried the clothes.' 'Abby dried out the room with a dehumidifier.'
Setting_fire	This frame describes either the creation of a Flame by a Kindler or non-sentient Cause, or the igniting of Flammables by a Kindler or a Cause.  'Taliban militants recently set fire to several schools.'  'The fire ignited. CNI' 
Cause_temperature_change	In this frame, an Agent changes the temperature of an Item.  A Temperature_goal can specify the desired temperature.  A Temperature_change can also be indicated.  The Temperature_start indicates the initial temperature.  'Margaret Anne chilled the salad to 30 degrees.' 'Heat the water 30 degrees.'
Cooking_creation	This frame describes food and meal preparation.  A Cook creates a Produced_food from (raw) Ingredients.  The Heating_Instrument and/or the Container may also be specified.  'Caitlin baked some cookies from the pre-packaged dough.' 
Cause_to_fragment	An Agent suddenly and often violently separates the Whole_patient into two or more smaller Pieces, resulting in the Whole_patient no longer existing as such.  Several lexical items are marked with the semantic type Negative, which indicates that the fragmentation is necessarily judged as injurious to the original Whole_patient.  Compare this frame with Damaging, Render_non-functional, and Removing.  'He ripped up the letter faster than you can say "Jack Robbins". INI' 'Don't go in there or you 'll be torn to bits! CNI' 'She shattered the vase with a casual backhand blow to make it look like there had been a struggle. INI' 'Tear into 6" strips, each about one inch wide, then bake at 400. CNI CNI'
Cause_harm	The words in this frame describe situations in which an Agent or a Cause injures a Victim. The Body_part of the Victim which is most directly affected may also be mentioned in the place of the Victim.  In such cases, the Victim is often indicated as a genitive modifier of the Body_part, in which case the Victim FE is indicated on a second FE layer. '' 'Rod saw his father beating his mother.'  'In the end Wormtongue is fed up with being beaten so he cuts Saruman's throat to free himself.'  'A mother stabbed to death by her husband made a secret will stating that he must never be allowed to care for their son.'
Hunting	A Hunter tries to gain Food by way of outsmarting or tracking a living. The Hunter hopes the attempt will result in the catching and killing of the living entity that is intended for human consumption. The act of seeking Food inherently involves the assistance of some tool, which can be an extension of the Hunter's body or an artifact fashioned or exploited for the use of food seeking, catching, and/or killing.  'In the Congo, he hunted big game for the first time.'  'People still fish bass in the lake.'  'Folks from Northern California hunt brilliantly. INI ' 
Cutting	An Agent cuts a Item into Pieces using an Instrument (which may or may not be expressed).  'At the ceremony, the CEO cut the red ribbon hanging across the main entrance into a glorious confetti.'
Inhibit_movement	An Agent restricts the movement of a Theme to within the vicinity of the Holding_location, despite the Theme's desire, plan, or tendency towards motion; the Agent may also use an Instrument. Alternatively, there may be a non-sentient Cause instead of an Agent restricting the Theme.  For many of these targets, the means is incorporated.  For some LUs, the Theme is required to be a sentient entity.  Several of these LUs may be used to describe punishment situations when the Theme is a sentient entity.    'They held the package for two months in the border-patrol locker room .'
Cure	This frame deals with a Healer treating and curing an Affliction (the injuries, disease, or pain) of the Patient, sometimes also mentioning the use of a particular Treatment or Medication. This frame differs from Medical_intervention in that this frame deals only with cases in which the Patient is cured of the Affliction, not just treated for the Affliction. '' 'Isis then cured Re by reciting a spell.'  'Another student became convinced that God was going to heal the clergyman of his cancer.'
Education_teaching	This frame contains words referring to teaching and the participants in teaching.  A Student comes to learn either about a Subject; a Skill; a Precept; or a Fact as a result of instruction by a Teacher.  Some of the nouns (schoolmaster, -mistress) in this frame refer to administrative positions and do not take relevant frame elements; these will be moved.    'Dad taught <fex name="">me that if you work hard, you will be OK - no matter what happens. '  'What Our Cat  taught Me  About Marketing!'  'For two years she taught me French'  'Mom and Dad taught me not to bullshit, because it always came back to bite me in the ass, without fail. '  'A young swiss girl up in a swiss chalet taught me how to yodel.'  'Young Murdock later met a blind martial arts master known as Stick, who taught him how to use his augmented senses and trained him as a fighter.'  ' Maria, a woman studying to be a nun is sent from her convent to be the governess of the seven children of a widowed naval captain '  Frame-Element relations:  Several Frame element relations hold in this frame. There is a core-set {Material, Teacher} (possibly also including Institution); these FE's can fill the subject slot of the teach-type verbs. There is another core-set  {Precept, Subject, Skill, Fact, Role} to do with what is learnt. In addition, the FE Qualification may occur with Subject and Role  'My sister is studying for a maths degree    to be a teacher ' 'She's studying maths to be a teacher .'  Phrases expressing Qualification also very often include information about the Subject (see below), which is to be annotated on the second layer.  'Bill is studying for a BS in physics/a maths degree.' 'Bill is studying for a BS in physics/a maths degree.'  
Commercial_transaction	These are words that describe basic commercial transactions involving a Buyer and a Seller who exchange Money and Goods.  The individual words vary in the frame element realization patterns. For example, the typical patterns for the verbs buy and sell are: BUYER buys GOODS from the SELLER for MONEY. SELLER sells GOODS to the BUYER for MONEY.  'His $20 transaction with Amazon.com for a new TV had been very smooth.'
Agriculture	In this frame an Agriculturist cultivates Food.  The location or Ground where the Food is cultivated by the Agriculturist is often expressed.  '' 'Peasants were encouraged to cultivate basic food crops such as beans and corn'.  'Shrimp farming seems to be a recipe for disaster'  'Some fields were probably cultivated only in the dry season CNI'
Light_movement	An Emitter emits a Beam of light from a Source, along a Path, and/or towards a Goal.  Essentially, this frame denotes the (semi-)fictive motion of the the Beam. 'Avoid allowing light to shine into neighbors' gardens.' 'Clear yellow sunlight shone through the window-panes.' 'She thinks the sun shines out of his backside.' '...when the candles shine out.' 'It shines in my eyes. ('It' is both Beam and Emitter, though only one will show up in the display.) ' '...light shines down on the world.' 'The moonlight shone off the fields.' 'The candlelight glinted from pearls and rubies.'
Rite	This frame concerns rituals performed in line with religious beliefs or tradition.  'In certain fertility rites in Burma , a woman desirous of offspring is required not only to approach the King Cobra but to plant a kiss on its mouth .'  'He was ordered a priest in 1944. CNI '
None of above
